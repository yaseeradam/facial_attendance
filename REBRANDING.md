## Note About Folder Name

The project folder is still named `frontalminds_fr` for technical reasons (Dart package names can't have spaces or special characters). This is normal and doesn't affect the app's displayed name.

If you want to rename the folder later:
1. Rename the folder to `face_mark`
2. Update `name: frontalminds_fr` to `name: face_mark` in pubspec.yaml
3. Update import statements
4. Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`

## ✅ Status: Complete!

Your app is now branded as **FACE MARK** - Smart Face Recognition Attendance System! 🎉
